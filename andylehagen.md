# Project Name
Custom Mechanical Keyboard

## Summary

I am going to build a custom keyboard with the use of the grant money. It will have a 65% layout and gateron yellow switches. I am excited to build this because I have always wanted to build my own keyboard. I have consumed many building tutorials online and I believe that it will be a great learning experience.

## Plan

The tool I will need is a screwdriver kit, with many different screwdriver sizes. I already own one so I plan on using it for this build. I will also need a keycap puller, which I already own. On many custom keyboard builds, you may need to solder, but since this keyboard is going to have a hot-swappable PCB, soldering is not required. First, I am going to test all the connections on the hot-swap sockets on the PCB in order to make sure it is fully functioning. I will need to install a keyboard tester software and plug it into your PC in order to do this. After making sure that all the connections are working, I will need to assemble the case, hot-swap PCB, and stabilizers together. Next, I will need to put my switches into the PCB. It is important to be careful when putting them in as you do not want the pins of the switch to bend or get damaged. Lastly, I will need to put on the keycaps. I plan on using keycaps from one of my old keyboards. Since they are both MX-style keycaps, they should fit fine into this custom keyboard build.
